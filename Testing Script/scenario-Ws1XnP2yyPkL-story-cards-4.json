You can disable this in the Script Settings Story Card, but I wouldn't suggest it since it is designed to be as seamless as possible without requiring any additional effort from the user. All you need to do is mention the name, and other information about your servant at Any point in the story with hashtag followed by a double dash \"#--\" in front and the same but in reverse \"--#\" in the back of your input. Only use # for Servant information. But don't worry, the script will automatically remove all \"#-- --#\" from your story so that there is no break in immersion. ",
